Project Definition: Quantum Key Distribution Using Photons
Objective:
The goal of this project is to explore and simulate the principles of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) using photons as a means to securely exchange encryption keys. The project will focus on simulating QKD protocols, addressing practical challenges of long-distance implementation, and investigating how QKD can be integrated into modern telecom infrastructure for secure communication.

Key Areas of Focus:
Simulation of QKD Systems:

Simulate the transmission and detection of photon states (polarization or entanglement) as part of QKD protocols.
Analyze how changes in these quantum states affect the security of the key exchange process.
Use simulation tools to demonstrate how eavesdropping attempts can be detected based on alterations to the photon states.
Research on Practical Challenges:

Investigate the effects of photon loss and errors in photon detection during long-distance communication.
Explore solutions to these challenges, such as quantum repeaters, and their role in extending the transmission range of QKD systems.
Integration into Telecom Infrastructure:

Explore how QKD could be deployed alongside classical telecommunications infrastructure (fiber-optic networks, satellite communications).
Assess the potential benefits and limitations of integrating QKD for secure communication in modern industries.
Core Components:
QKD Protocols:
Implement and simulate two key protocols: the BB84 protocol (using polarized photons) and the E91 protocol (using quantum entanglement).
Photon State Simulation:
Simulate the behavior of photon states during transmission, focusing on their security properties (i.e., how quantum mechanics guarantees the detection of eavesdropping).
Challenges and Solutions:
Investigate the real-world issues of photon loss, error rates, and the limitations of current detection systems, as well as potential mitigation strategies.
Telecom Integration:
Analyze the compatibility of QKD with existing telecommunications infrastructure and explore case studies or trials (e.g., quantum satellites or quantum repeaters).
